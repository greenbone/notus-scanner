# Installation
To install Notus Python 3.7 and later is required.

Besides Python Notus Scanner also needs to have

- paho-mqtt
- psutil
- python-gnupg

To retrieve package-lists and publish results Notus needs a MQTT broker running.

To install a local MQTT-broker on debian you can execute:

```
$ apt-get install mosquitto 
```

To configure mosquitto please consolidate [man mosquitto.conf](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html).

To install notus you can use poetry to create a wheel package

```
> poetry install
> poetry build -f wheel
```

which you can then use to install it via `pip`:

```
> pip install notus_scanner-22.4.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

After that you should create a configuration.


# Configuration

If you want a configuration system-wide you should create it in `/etc/gvm/notus-scanner.toml`;
if you want to use a user specific configuration create it in `~/.config/notus-scanner.toml`.

```toml
[notus-scanner]
mqtt-broker-address = "localhost"
mqtt-broker-port = "1883"
products-directory = "/var/lib/openvas/plugins/notus/products"
pid-file = "/var/run/notus-scanner/notus-scanner.pid"
log-file = "/var/log/notus-scanner/notus-scanner.log"
log-level = "INFO"
disable-hashsum-verification = false
```

Each setting can be overridden via an environment variable or command line
argument.
